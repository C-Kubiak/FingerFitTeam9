## \- Changelog -



#### 9/27/25

* Changed Settings menu button to toggle the menu off/on instead of reopening and repeating the fade in.
* Settings menu "reset to default" option now adjusts UI elements accordingly to match actual values.





#### 9/26/25



* Created new Git Repo with project contents
* Reworked TypeRushManager script to highlight correct text in green and incorrect text in red as user types. Additionally the user is no longer charged with mistakes for backspaces.

  * Reason: Easier for users to find where mistakes are made, and mistakes don't count as double anymore. This change is more in line with Typeracer and other typing games.







## \- Known Issues -



* After entering TypeRush from the main menu, and returning to the main menu, the TypeRush button is unable to load the minigame a second time.
* Red highlighted text for incorrect words does not account for spaces, a semi-transparent highlighted box will likely work better for more precise locating typing errors.
