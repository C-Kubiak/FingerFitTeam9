# FingerFit











## \- Changelog -

#### 9/26/25



* Created new Git Repo with project contents
* Reworked TypeRushManager script to highlight correct text in green and incorrect text in red as user types. Additionally the user is no longer charged with mistakes for backspaces.
  * Reason: Easier for users to find where mistakes are made, and mistakes don't count as double anymore. This change is more in line with Typeracer and other typing games.
