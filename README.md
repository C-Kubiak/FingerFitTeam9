# FingerFit











## \- Changelog -

#### 9/26/25



* Created new Git Repo with project contents
* Reworked TypeRushManager script adding a brief flashing red letter for incorrect inputs and auto-deletion for incorrect inputs
  * Reason: Too easy to miss a single letter and rack up large mistake count. This change is more in line with Typeracer and other typing games.
